            <h3>Basics of java</h3>
            <p>Currently, I am diving into Java, and it is quite a challenging but fascinating journey. Java is a powerful programming language commonly used for building applications, games, and software tools. While it is not the easiest language to grasp, it's complexity adds to the intrigue. I am navigating through concepts like object-oriented programming, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are fundamental to Java. Despite the hurdles, every new concept I grasp feels like unlocking a new door to endless possibilities in the world of coding. Learning Java might be tough, but the excitement of mastering it keeps me motivated</p>
